Well I was high and mighty for quite a long time
Doing what was natural just to try to unwind
Then I took a tumble and promises were mumbled
Next thing in the morning I wake up in this jungle
I feel my heart is pumping to the beat of the band
Certain things are happening that I don't understand
Everyone is glaring, the saxophone is blaring
Hope you understand but I just can't keep from staring
I'm talking to you I'm talking to you I'm talking to you

Well I walk around town with a dime store smile
Trying to find a little comfort, trying to show a little style
Man tried to fake me when others tried to take me
Never really sure if they're ever going to break me
Sitting in this bar and I'm almost broke
Choking on emotion and the cigarette smoke
As long as you can pay the band is going to play
Hope you understand but I feel I gotta say it
I'm talking to you I'm talking to you I'm talking to you
