You're darkest at midnight
What's as black as your insides
The dark is, the dark is, the dark is

Why you clawing at your insides
Where instinct is waiting
Why'd ya wanna wear it so tight
Why'd ya wanna wear it out

I don't wanna, I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna, I don't wanna talk about it

You're starkest at midnight
Even your shadow is tongue-tied
You're talking, we're talking, no talking

Why you clawing at your insides
Where instinct is waiting
Why'd ya wanna wear it so tight
Why'd ya wanna wear it out

I don't wanna, I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna, I don't wanna talk about it

I don't wanna, I don't wanna, wanna, wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna, I don't wanna talk about it

You still want to talk about it
I'm so sick of talking about it
You still want to talk about it
I'm so sick of talking and talking and talking and talking...

I don't wanna, I don't wanna, wanna, wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna talk

I don't wanna, I don't wanna talk about it

I don't wanna, I don't wanna, wanna, wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna talk
